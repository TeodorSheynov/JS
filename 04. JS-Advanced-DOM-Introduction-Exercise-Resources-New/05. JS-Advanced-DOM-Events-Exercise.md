**Environment Specifics**

Please, be aware that every JS environment may **behave differently**
when executing code. Certain things that work in the browser are not
supported in **Node.js**, which is the environment used by **Judge**.

The following actions are **NOT** supported:

-   **.forEach()** with **NodeList** (returned by **querySelector()**
    and **querySelectorAll()**)

-   **.forEach()** with **HTMLCollection** (returned by
    **getElementsByClassName()** and **element.children**)

-   Using the **spread-operator** (**...**) to convert a **NodeList**
    into an array

-   **append()** in Judge (use only **appendChild()**)

-   **prepend()**

-   Always turn the collection into an **JS array** (forEach,
    forOf, et.)

If you want to perform these operations, you may use **Array.from()** to
first convert the collection into an array.

Sections
--------

You will receive an **array** of strings. For each string, create a
**div** with a **paragraph** with the **string** in it. Each paragraph
is initially **hidden (display:none)**. Add a **click** **event**
**listener** to **each div** that **displays** the **hidden** paragraph.
Finally, you should **append** all divs to the element with an **id**
"**content**".

**Example**

![](media/image1.png){width="3.121052055993001in"
height="3.1496062992125986in"}
![](media/image2.png){width="3.1878291776028in"
height="3.1496062992125986in"}

Time Converter
--------------

Create a program that **converts** different time units. Your task is to
add a **click** event listener to **all** \[**CONVERT**\] **buttons**.
When a button is **clicked**, read the **corresponding** input field,
**convert** the value to the **three other** time units and **display**
it in the input fields.

**Example**

![](media/image3.png){width="6.375980971128609in" height="4.41in"}

![](media/image4.png){width="6.3689041994750655in"
height="4.939748468941382in"}

One day is equal to 24 hours/1440 minutes/86400 seconds. Whichever
button we **click,** the input fields should **change** depending on the
added value on the left. (For example, if we write 48 hours and click
convert the days, the field value should change to 2).

Locked Profile
--------------

In this problem, you should **create a JS functonality** which **shows**
and **hides** the additional

information about users.

![](media/image5.png){width="6.003981846019248in"
height="2.5166666666666666in"}

When one of the \[**Show more**\] **buttons** is clicked, the **hiden
information** inside the div should

be shown, only if **the profile is not locked**! If the current profile
is **locked,** nothing should

happen.

![](media/image6.png){width="5.895612423447069in"
height="3.1458333333333335in"}

If the **hidden information is displayed** and we **lock** **the profile
again**, the \[**Hide it**\] button

should **not be working**! Otherwise, when the profile is **unlocked**
and we click on the **\[Hide it\]**

button, the new fields must hide again.

Fill Dropdown
-------------

Your task is to take values from **input** fields with **ids
"newItemText"** and **"newItemValue"**. Then you should create and
append an **&lt;option&gt;** to the **&lt;select&gt;** with **id**
**"menu".**

**Example**

![](media/image7.png){width="7.195395888013998in" height="1.64in"}

**Hints**

-   Your function should take the values of **newItemText** and
    **newItemValue**. After that you should create a new **option**
    element and set its **textContent** and its **value** to the newly
    taken ones.

-   Once you have done all of that, you should **append** the newly
    created **option** as a **child** to the **select** item with id
    **"menu".**

-   Finally, you should **clear** the value of the two **input** fields.

Encode and Decode Messages
--------------------------

In this problem, you should **create a JS functonality** which **encodes
and decodes some**

**messages which travel to the network.**

![](media/image8.png){width="5.447259405074366in"
height="3.595138888888889in"}

This program should contain **two functionalities**.

The first one is to **encode the given message** and **send it** to the
**receiver**.

The second one is to **decode the received message** and **read it
(display it)**.

When the \[**Encode and send it**\] **button** is clicked, you should
get the given message from the first textarea. When you get the current
message, you should encode it as follows:

-   **Change** the **ASCII CODE** on **every single character** in that
    message when you **add 1** to the current **ASCII NUMBER**, that
    represent the current character in that message

-   **Clear** the **sender** **textarea** and **added** the encoded
    message to the **receiver textarea**

![](media/image9.png){width="5.1222659667541555in"
height="3.285416666666667in"}

*After clicking \[**Encode and send it**\] **button** the result should
be:*

![](media/image10.png){width="5.158435039370079in"
height="3.3041666666666667in"}

After that, when the \[**Decode and read it**\] **button** is clicked.
You need to get the **encoded message** from **the receiver textarea**
and do the **opposite logic** from encoding:

-   **Subtract 1** from the current **ASCII NUMBER**, that represents
    the current character in that message

-   Replace the **encoded message** with the already **decoded message**
    in the receiver textrea, to make it readable

![](media/image11.png){width="5.6125in" height="3.5353094925634294in"}

Furniture
---------

You will be given some furniture as an **array of objects**. Each object
will have a **name**, a **price** and a **decoration factor**.

When the **"Generate" button is clicked**, add a **new row to the
table** for each piece of furniture with **image, name, price** and
**decoration factor** (code example below).

When the **"Buy"** button is clicked, get all **checkboxes that are
marked** and show in the **result textbox** the **names** of the piece
of furniture that **were checked**, separated by a **comma** and
**single** **space** (**", "**) in the following format: **"Bought
furniture: {furniture1}, {furniture2}…"**.

On the next line, print the total price in format: **"Total price:
{totalPrice}"** (formatted to the second decimal point). Finally, print
the average decoration factor in the format: **"Average decoration
factor: {decFactor}"**

### Input Example

> **\[{"name": "Sofa", "img":
> "https://res.cloudinary.com/maisonsdumonde/image/upload/q\_auto,f\_auto/w\_200/img/grey-3-seater-sofa-bed-200-13-0-175521\_9.jpg",
> "price": 150, "decFactor": 1.2}\]**

Distance Converter \*
---------------------

Your task is to convert from **one** distance unit to **another** by
adding a **click** event listener to a button. When it is clicked,
**read** the value from the input field and **get** the **selected**
option from the **input** and **output** units drop downs. Then
**calculate** and **display** the converted value in the **disabled**
output field.

**Example**

![](media/image14.png){width="6.3588932633420825in" height="1.94in"}

**Hints**

-   Multiply the incoming distance by the following conversion rates to
    convert to meter

-   Divide to convert from meters to the required output unit

-   To see which option is selected, read the properties of its parent:
    **value** gives you the value of the selected option (as displayed
    in the HTML), **selectedIndex** gives you the 0-based index of the
    selected option. For example, if miles are selected,
    **inputUnits.value** is "**mi**", **inputUnits.selectedIndex** is
    **4**. Option text is irrelevant

-   Use the following table information to do that:

  **1 km**    **1000 m**
  ----------- ---------------
  **1 m**     **1 m**
  **1 cm**    **0.01 m**
  **1 mm**    **0.001 m**
  **1 mi**    **1609.34 m**
  **1 yrd**   **0.9144 m**
  **1 ft**    **0.3048 m**
  **1 in**    **0.0254 m**

Sudomu \*
---------

Write a function that implements **SUDOMU** (**Sudoku inside the DOM**).

![](media/image15.png){width="6.482492344706912in"
height="2.5194444444444444in"}

The rules are simple and they are **the same** as the **typical sudoku
game** (for more information,

click
[*here*](https://sudoku.com/how-to-play/sudoku-rules-for-complete%20beginners/))

If the table is filled with the **right numbers**, and the "**Quick
Check**" button is **clicked**, the

expected result should be:

![](media/image16.png){width="6.182692475940508in"
height="2.7570614610673667in"}

The table borer should be changed to: "**2px solid green".** The **text
content** of the **paragraph**

inside the **div** with an **id** "**check**" must be "**You solve it!
Congratulations!**"

The text color of that paragraph must be **green. **

Otherwise, when the filled table **does not solve** **the sudomu,** the
result should be:

![](media/image17.png){width="6.173077427821522in"
height="2.6314720034995625in"}

The table border should be changed to: "**2px solid red**".

The **text content** of the **paragraph** inside the **div** with an
**id** "**check**" must be:

"**NOP! You are not done yet...**"

The text color of that paragraph must be **red!**

The "**Clear**" button **clears the whole** **SUDOMU (removes all
numbers)** and the **paragraph**

**which contains the messages. It also removes the table border. **

JavaScript Quizz \*
-------------------

Write a function that has the functionality of a quiz.

![](media/image18.png){width="6.423406605424322in"
height="2.5114577865266843in"}

There are three **sections** that contain **one question** **and 2
possible answers. **

**The right answer is only one!**

When one of the **list elements is clicked,** the next section **must
appear (if any…)**.

After all three questions have been answered, the **results ul** must
**appear,** (Use **'none'** and **'block**' to hide and show the
question sections), and the results must be added in the h1.

If all questions are answered correctly, you should prin the following
message:\
"**You are recognized as top JavaScript fan!**"

Otherwise, just print "**You have {rightAnswers} right answers**".

The right answers are (**onclick, JSON.stringify() and A programming API
for HTML and XML documents**).
